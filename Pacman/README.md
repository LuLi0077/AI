The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.


## Projects

* P1 - [Search](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/search.html): implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

* P2 - [Multi-Agent Search](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/multiagent.html): implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

* P3 - [Reinforcement Learning](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/reinforcement.html): implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

* P4 - [Ghostbusters](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/tracking.html): implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.   

* P5 - [Classification](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/classification.html): implement standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits then extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.

* P6 - [Contest: Pacman Capture the Flag](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/contest.html): create strategies for a team of two agents to play a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman.
